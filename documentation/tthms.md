# Total Trihalomethanes (TTHMs)

## What is it?
Trihalomethanes are a group of chemicals that form when hydrogen atoms in methane are replaced with halogens. Some trihalomethanes are used in refrigeration (Freon, R-22) or as industrial solvents (chloroform).

## Where does it come from?
In drinking water, trihalomethanes are typically a by-product of using chlorine to disinfect water. 

## Health effects
Drinking water with high concentrations of TTHMs over a long time could result in liver, kidney or nervous system damage, or increased risk of cancer.
