# Selenium

## What is it?
Selenium is a non-metallic chemical element. It is used in many industrial applications, including electronics, glassmaking, and metal alloys such as brass.

## Where does it come from?
It occurs in natural deposits, where it dissolves into groundwater. It can also occur in runoff from farms, factories, refineries and mines.

## Health effects
Selenium is an essential nutrient that plays a part in thyroid function. It's recommended daily allowance for most adults is 55 micrograms per day. Selenium deficiency is rare in healthy individuals.

Excessive selenium is toxic. The tolerable upper intake level is 400 micrograms per day, or a little more than seven times the RDA. Excessive intake for a long time (many years) can lead to loss of hair and fingernails and poor circulation.
