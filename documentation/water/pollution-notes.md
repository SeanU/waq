# Sources for information on pollutants

(side note: national ground water monitoring network: http://cida.usgs.gov/ngwmn/index.jsp)


### 1: EPA Zendesk site
https://safewater.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/201454937-Fact-Sheets

* Contains information on pollutants, intended for public consumption, compiled by EPA.
* Fairly simplistic, easy to digest info on possible health risks.
* UX kinda sucks - each paragraph is on a separate page, rather than being a single page with headings for the kinds of info.

### 2: EPA - Variance rules
https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/variances-and-exemptions

* Rules on when the EPA grants exemptions for municipal water systems

### 3: PubChem
https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

* _Very_ detailed information about chemicals.
* Covers much more than EPA zen desk
* Will probably need to curate information we provide if we use it as a resource - there's a lot of info that is probably not interesting to anyone who isn't a specialist of some sort.
