# Lead

## What is it?
Lead is a toxic heavy metal. Historically it was used in many household products and solder in plumbing and electronics.

## Where does it come from?
Most household exposure comes from lead paint in older homes. Less often, significant exposure can also come from the water supply.

In the USA, the use of lead in plumbing has been resricted, but not banned, since 1986. Buildings and water systems constructed prior to that date may have higher levels than more recent plumbing.

## Health effects
Children are especially vulnerable to lead, and can experience developmental delays as a result of lead exposure.

Adults are much less susceptible, but may experience kidney problems or high blood pressure if they regularly consume water containing high levels of lead over many years.
