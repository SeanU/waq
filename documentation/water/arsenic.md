# Arsenic

## What is it?
Arsenic is either the villain or the protagonist in most Edward Gorey stories.

Arsenic gets into water from natural deposits, or from runoff from agricltural and industral operations.

## Health effects
Arsenic is a potent poison, and the EPA has set a limit of 10 parts per billion in drinking water. Drinking water with concentrations well above this level for a long time may lead to arsenic poisoning and increased risk of cancer.
