<h1>Sources for information on pollutants</h1>
<p>(side note: national ground water monitoring network: http://cida.usgs.gov/ngwmn/index.jsp)</p>
<h3>1: EPA Zendesk site</h3>
<p>https://safewater.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/201454937-Fact-Sheets</p>
<ul>
<li>Contains information on pollutants, intended for public consumption, compiled by EPA.</li>
<li>Fairly simplistic, easy to digest info on possible health risks.</li>
<li>UX kinda sucks - each paragraph is on a separate page, rather than being a single page with headings for the kinds of info.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2: EPA - Variance rules</h3>
<p>https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/variances-and-exemptions</p>
<ul>
<li>Rules on when the EPA grants exemptions for municipal water systems</li>
</ul>
<h3>3: PubChem</h3>
<p>https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Very</em> detailed information about chemicals.</li>
<li>Covers much more than EPA zen desk</li>
<li>Will probably need to curate information we provide if we use it as a resource - there's a lot of info that is probably not interesting to anyone who isn't a specialist of some sort.</li>
</ul>
