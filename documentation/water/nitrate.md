# Nitrate

## What is it?
Nitrate is an ion with the chemicla formula NO₃⁻. Nitrate readily combines with other chemicals to form compounds such as nitrate salts. Nitrate is a plant nutrient, and naturally occurs in many foods such as green vegetables and cured meats.

## Where does it come from?
Nitrates naturally occur in the soil. They are also commonly included in fertilizers.

## Health effects
Excessive nitrate can be toxic to humans. Infants are especially vulnerable, and some adults may be more sensitive to nitrate than others. Signs of nitrate toxicity include elevated heart rate and respiration.

## Environmental Impact
In freshwater ecosystems, nitrate can build up to levels that are directly toxic to aquatic life. It can also lead to algae blooms that kill animals by depleting the water of oxygen.
