<h1>Copper</h1>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>Copper is a common metal.</p>
<h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
<p>In groundwater, it usually comes from natural deposits. In household water, it mostly comes from copper pipes. Acidic water is more corrosive, so it will tend to pick up more copper. It is also present in food.</p>
<h2>Health effects</h2>
<p>Copper is an essential nutrient with a recommended dietary allowance of 0.9 mg/day for most adults. The recommended upper intake limit is 10mg/day.</p>
<p>Copper deficiency can result in fatigue, low bone density, and poor growth in children. </p>
<p>Excessive copper intake can cause liver, kidney and brain damage. With the exception of people with Wilson's disease, a rare genetic disorder, most people are not particularly susceptible to copper toxicity from drinking water.</p>
