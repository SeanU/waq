# Nitrite

## What is it?
Nitrate is an ion with the chemicla formula NO₂⁻. 

## Where does it come from?
Nitrite naturally forms when ammonia oxidizes. Ammonia, in turn, is formed when organic materials decompose. In food, it typically comes from vegetables and cured meats. In groundwater, it typically occurs as a result of nitrogen fertilizer.

## Health effects
Nitrite is recognized as being "probably carcinogenic" by the WHO. Compared to nitrate, it is acutely toxic to humans at relatively low concentrations. Signs of toxicity include elevated hart rate and respiration.
