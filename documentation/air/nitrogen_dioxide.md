# Nitrogen Dioxide

## What is it?
Nitrogen dioxide is a highly reactive gas.

## Where does it come from?
The main environmental source is fuel combustion in vehicles and power plants.

## Health effects
Nitrogen dioxide is a strong irritant that can cause inflammation of the airway in healthy people. It also worsens the symptoms of respiratory diseases such as asthma. There is some evidence that long-term exposure to elevated levels increases the risk of developing asthma.

## Environmental Impact
Nitrogen oxides, including nitrogen dioxide, react with water to form acid rain. They are also a major component of smog.
