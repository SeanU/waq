# Particulates

## What is it?
Particulates are small particles of solid or liquid matter such as dust and soot.

## Where does it come from?
Particulates can come from many sources, including burning of fossil fuels and other fires. Activities that create dust, such as construction, also contribute to particulates.

## Health effects
