# Ozone

## What is it?
Ozone is a sharp-smelling gas. While ozone in the upper atmosphere is beneficial, ozone at ground level can be harmful.

## Where does it come from?
Ozone is formed when nitrogen oxides react with certain kinds of organic chemicals. Nitrogen oxides, in turn, are primarily formed as a by-product of burning fossil fuels.

## Health effects
Ozone irritates the respiratory system. It is particularly harmful to asthmatics, children and the elderly. It can worsen many respiratory ailments, including asthma, but also others such as emphysema and bronchitis.

## Environmental Impact
Ozone is the principal ingredient in smog. It also harms plants by interfering with their ability to photosynthesize.
