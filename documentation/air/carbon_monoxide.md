# Carbon Monoxide

## What is it?
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas.

## Where does it come from?
Carbon monoxide is a by-product of combustion. The main source of carbon monoxide in outdoor air is cars and trucks. Other machinery that burns fuel, such as generators and power plants, also produces carbon monoxide. 

The most common indoor sources of carbon monoxide are gas furnaces and stoves, and other heat sources that rely on combustion such as kerosene heaters and fireplaces.

## Health effects
Breathing carbon monoxide reduces the amount of oxygen that your blood can carry. Very high levels of carbon monoxide can cause dizziness and confusion, and may be fatal. Such high concentrations are more likely to happen indoors. However, outdoor concentrations may still be high enough to cause problems for people with heart or lung disease.
