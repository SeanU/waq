# Lead (in air)

## What is it?
Lead is a toxic heavy metal.

## Where does it come from?
Major sources of lead in the air include leaded aviation fuel, metal smelting and waste incineration.

Historically, the primary source of lead in the air was leaded gasoline. Lead levels in the air have dropped by 98% since lead was phased out of automotive fuel in the 1970s.

## Health effects
Children are especially vulnerable to lead, and can experience developmental delays as a result of lead exposure.

Adults are much less susceptible, but may experience kidney problems or high blood pressure if they regularly consume water containing high levels of lead over many years.
