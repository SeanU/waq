<h1>Total Coliform</h1>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p> Total coliforms are a group of related bacteria that are (with few exceptions) not harmful to humans. A variety of bacteria, parasites, and viruses, known as pathogens, can potentially cause health problems if humans ingest them. EPA considers total coliforms a useful indicator of other pathogens for drinking water. </p>
<h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
<p>Total coliforms are used to determine the adequacy of water treatment and the integrity of the distribution system.</p>
<h2>Health effects</h2>
<p> Coliform bacteria are usually not harmful organisms, and are only mildly infectious, but if large numbers of coliforms are found in water, there is a high probability that other harmful bacteria may be present. Health effects can vary widely based on what pathogens are present.
