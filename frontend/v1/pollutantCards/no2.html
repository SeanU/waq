<h1>Nitrogen Dioxide</h1>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide is a highly reactive gas.</p>
<h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
<p>The main environmental source is fuel combustion in vehicles and power plants.</p>
<h2>Health effects</h2>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide is a strong irritant that can cause inflammation of the airway in healthy people. It also worsens the symptoms of respiratory diseases such as asthma. There is some evidence that long-term exposure to elevated levels increases the risk of developing asthma.</p>
<h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
<p>Nitrogen oxides, including nitrogen dioxide, react with water to form acid rain. They are also a major component of smog.</p>
